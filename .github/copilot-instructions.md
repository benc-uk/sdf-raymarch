# Copilot Instructions for SDF-Fun

## Project Overview

This is a WebGL2 raymarching renderer for Signed Distance Functions (SDF), built with modern JavaScript and GLSL shaders. The project creates real-time 3D scenes using mathematical distance functions instead of traditional polygonal meshes.

## IMPORTANT

ALWAYS FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WHEN ANSWERING:

- NEVER try to run the server, as this is a graphical application that requires a browser environment you will not see any errors in the terminal if something is wrong with the shaders or WebGL setup.
- NEVER try to execute or via npm start or any other command, as you cannot run the code.
- ALWAYS focus on static analysis of the code and reasoning about its structure, logic, and patterns.
- ALWAYS provide code suggestions based on understanding of WebGL, GLSL, and raymarching

Never check any files or paths in are in the .gitignore file
